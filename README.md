# Project Overview: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction:
The "Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning" project aims to leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the market prices of automobiles. By utilizing a dataset containing various car features and corresponding prices, this project explores the application of regression models for accurate price forecasting.

## Key Steps:

### Data Import and Exploration:

- Importing essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Loading the dataset from Google Drive and exploring its structure using basic statistical measures and visualization tools.
### Data Cleaning:

- Identifying and handling missing values in the dataset.
- Exploring unique values in the 'CarName' column to ensure data consistency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualizing the distribution of car prices to understand the overall market trend.
- Investigating correlations between different features to identify potential predictors.
### Feature Selection:

- Selecting relevant independent features for the model, including parameters such as car dimensions, engine specifications, and fuel efficiency.
### Model Building:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
- Implementing three different regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
### Model Training and Evaluation:

- Training each model on the training set.
- Making predictions on the test set and evaluating model accuracy using the coefficient of determination (R-squared).
### Model Comparison:

- Creating a visual representation of model performance through a bar plot, comparing the accuracy scores of Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
## Results and Conclusion:
The project concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the machine learning models, providing insights into their predictive capabilities for car prices. The comparison of models aids in identifying the most effective algorithm for this specific prediction task. This project serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in understanding and implementing machine learning techniques for car price prediction in the automotive industry.
